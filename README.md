ComposeTemplate

This is an experimental app leveraging on public or free apis. The goal of this project is to showcase a little bit the use of recent Android technologies such as Jetpack Compose, Koin, Ktor, Flows and so on.
I have little time to dedicate to this project, but I'll try to give it a direction if I can.

So far I have two branches and here's my plans for them:
- On the main branch I'm want to develop an app that given your actual position can give you the closest ski resorts in your area and suggest you where to go, basing on their state.
I'm using this freemium api for this purpose: https://rapidapi.com/random-shapes-random-shapes-default/api/ski-resorts-and-conditions which require an access token. To make it work just place your accesss token in the local.properties file like this
  resorts_key=aa9999aa9aaaa9a99a9aa1aaa99aa999a99aaa999999aaaa99
- On the jsonPlaceHolderApi branch I'll just showcase the tecnologies using public JsonPlaceHolder Apis
